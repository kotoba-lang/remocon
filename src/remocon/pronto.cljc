  "Philips Pronto hex <-> raw burst conversion.

  Pronto hex is the widely circulated code-table format (one line per
  signal): `0000 006C 0000 0022 00D6 ...` — the first word is the form
  (0000 = raw oscillated, 0100 = learned), second is carrier frequency in
  units of 0.241246 Hz (414.5156 us per unit — the Pronto clock), third is
  the once-part pair count, fourth the repeat-part pair count, then the
  flat pulse/space word list in 0.241246 ms-per-unit ticks.

  The clock constant (414.5156 us) is a spec-normative value from the
  Pronto format description, carried here as the single `:clock-us` def —
  it is NOT invented. Learned forms (0100) are accepted but marked so the
  caller can refuse to treat them as analytically derived.

  Fails closed: odd word counts, unknown forms, and once/repeat counts that
  do not match the word list all throw."
